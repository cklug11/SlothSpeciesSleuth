This project was submitted to fulfill the requirements for Western Governors University Computer Science Capstone. 

Built a Supervised Machine learning model using Logistic regression to predict a sloth's species based on specific metrics such as weight, height, and claw length with 96% accuracy. Extracted data from a Kaggle dataset, transformed the data within Juypter Notebook, and then evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and a classification report

Sloth Species Sleuth GUI. - GUI only works when you run the notebook in an interactive environment, so I decided to included a photo of the GUI
